# Multi-Agent Code Review

Run a comprehensive review of the current changes by spawning specialized review agents in parallel.

## Steps

1. First, determine the scope of the review. Resolve the base branch from
   AGENTS.md's `Base branch:` line, else `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q
   .defaultBranchRef.name`, else `main`:
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is a file path, review that file
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is a branch name, review `git diff <base>...$ARGUMENTS`
   - If no arguments, review all uncommitted changes (`git diff` + `git diff --cached` + untracked files)

2. Get the diff to understand what changed:
   ```
   !`git diff --stat HEAD`
   ```

3. Discover which reviewer agents actually exist — los que no aplican al stack se eliminan del repo (e.g. `reviewer-ui` on a backend-only project):
   ```
   !`ls .opencode/agents/reviewer-*.md 2>/dev/null`
   ```
   Spawn **one agent per discovered `reviewer-*` file, in parallel** using the
   `task` tool (or an `@agent-name` mention), each with the agent name matching the file. The full kit
   provides:
   - **reviewer-security** — Security vulnerabilities, injection risks, data exposure
   - **reviewer-ui** — Theme compliance, accessibility, responsive design, brand consistency
   - **reviewer-tests** — Missing tests, test quality, coverage gaps
   - **reviewer-performance** — API efficiency, bundle size, caching, slow patterns

   Only spawn the ones present on disk. Never invoke an agent whose file
   was deleted — skip its section in the report instead.

4. Each agent receives the same scope (files/diff) and reviews independently. Pass a `name:` for each agent so it's addressable, and bake an investigation budget and required output format into each spawn prompt (e.g. "Spend at most N tool calls, then emit the structured report. Do not stop without it."). If a final message lacks the structured report, re-spawn with a firmer lead-in; do not synthesize missing findings by hand.

5. After all agents complete, synthesize their findings into a unified report.
   Include only the sections for reviewers that actually ran:

```
# Code Review Summary

## Scope
[what was reviewed]

## Security
[findings from reviewer-security]

## UI / Theme
[findings from reviewer-ui]

## Test Coverage
[findings from reviewer-tests]

## Performance
[findings from reviewer-performance]

## Action Items
- [ ] Critical: ...
- [ ] High: ...
- [ ] Medium: ...
```

6. Present the unified report to the user.
