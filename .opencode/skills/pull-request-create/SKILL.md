# Pull Request Creation

Create a comprehensive pull request for the current branch.

## Steps

1. Determine the base branch first. Use `$ARGUMENTS` if provided; otherwise read
   the `Base branch:` line from AGENTS.md's Git Workflow section; otherwise detect
   it:

   ```bash
   BASE="${ARGUMENTS:-$(gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName 2>/dev/null \
     || gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name 2>/dev/null \
     || echo "main")}"
   ```

2. Gather context about the current state (substitute the resolved `$BASE`):

   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   git log --oneline "$BASE"..HEAD
   git diff --stat "$BASE"..HEAD
   ```
3. Analyze ALL commits on this branch (not just the latest) to understand the full scope of changes.
4. Draft the PR with this structure:

   - **Title**: Under 70 characters, imperative mood, describes the "what"
   - **Summary**: 1-3 bullet points explaining the changes
   - **Details**: Longer description if the change is complex
   - **Test plan**: How to verify the changes work
   - **Review checklist**: Areas reviewers should focus on
5. Before creating, show the draft to the user for approval.
6. Create the PR using `gh pr create`:

```bash
gh pr create --base "$BASE" --title "title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary

```

7. Return the PR URL to the user.

## Conventions

- Push to remote first if needed (`git push -u origin <branch>`)
- Never force-push without explicit user approval
- If the branch name contains an issue tracker ID (e.g., `scr-23`, `PROJ-456`), extract it and add `Closes [ID]` to the PR body — this auto-closes the issue on merge
- Write the closing keyword as plain text on its own line — `Closes TEAM-NNN`. Do NOT wrap it in bold, a markdown link, or a heading. The tracker's parser only detects the plain form; decorated formats link the PR as a reference but do not trigger the merge-to-Done automation
